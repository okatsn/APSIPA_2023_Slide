abstract = {Accurate estimates of root zone soil moisture (RZSM) at relevant spatio-temporal scales are essential for many agricultural and hydrological applications. Applications of machine learning (ML) techniques to estimate root zone soil moisture are limited compared to commonly used process-based models based on flow and transport equations in the vadose zone. However, data-driven ML techniques present unique opportunities to develop quantitative models without having assumptions on the processes operating within the system being investigated. In this study, the Random Forest (RF) ensemble learning algorithm, is tested to demonstrate the capabilities and advantages of ML for RZSM estimation. Interpolation and extrapolation of RZSM on a daily timescale was carried out using RF over a small agricultural catchment from 2016 to 2018 using in situ measurements. Results show that RF predictions have slightly higher accuracy for interpolation and similar accuracy for extrapolation in comparison with RZSM simulated from a process-based model combined with data assimilation. RF predictions for extreme wet and dry conditions were, however, less accurate. This was inferred to be due to infrequent sampling of such conditions that led to poor learning in the trained RF model and to incomplete representation of relevant subsurface processes at the study sites in the RF covariates. Since RF does not depend on parameters required to estimate subsurface water flow, it is more advantageous than a process-based model in data-poor regions where soil hydraulic parameters are incomplete or missing, especially when the primary goal is only the estimation of soil moisture states.}

  abstract  = {Soil water characteristic curve (SWCC) is one of the most essential hydraulic properties that play fundamental role in various environmental issues and water management. SWCC gives important information for water movement, soil behavior, infiltration, and drainage mechanism, affecting the water circle and the aquifer recharge. Since most of the world's freshwater withdrawals go for irrigation uses, decoding SWCC is beneficial, as it affects water saving through irrigation planning. Estimation of crucial parameters, such as field capacity (FC) and permanent wilting point (PWP) is the key solution for water saving. Modelling of the SWCC and hydraulic parameters estimation are of great importance, since the laboratory experimental procedures and the experiments in the field are often time-consuming processes. In the present study, the SWCC along with FC and PWP of two soil types were obtained via specific experimental procedures in the laboratory. In order to simulate the SWCC and estimate FC and PWP, the experimental data were approximated with van Genuchten's model. Results showed that using SWCC to estimate FC gives excellent results, while the method rationally overestimates the PWP. Hence, the presented method leads to estimation of crucial hydraulic parameters that can be used in irrigation planning and water saving practices.},

In this research, a new approach involving the use of advance machine learning (ML) models, and multi-sensor data fusion including Sentinel-1(S1) C-band dual polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR), Sentinel-2 (S2) multispectral data, and ALOS Global Digital Surface Model (ALOS DSM) to predict precisely soil moisture at 10 m spatial resolution across research areas in Australia. The total of 52 predictor variables generated from S1, S2 and ALOS DSM data fusion, including vegetation indices, soil indices, water index, SAR transformation indices, ALOS DSM derived indices like digital model elevation (DEM), slope, and topographic wetness index (TWI). The field soil data from Western Australia was employed. The performance capability of extreme gradient boosting regression (XGBR) together with the genetic algorithm (GA) optimizer for features selection and optimization for soil moisture prediction in bare lands was examined and compared with various scenarios and ML models. The proposed model (the XGBR-GA model) with 21 optimal features obtained from GA was yielded the highest performance (R2 = 0. 891; RMSE = 0.875%) compared to random forest regression (RFR), support vector machine (SVM), and CatBoost gradient boosting regression (CBR). Conclusively, the new approach using the XGBR-GA with features from combination of reliable free-of-charge remotely sensed data from Sentinel and ALOS imagery can effectively estimate the spatial variability of soil moisture. The described framework can further support precision agriculture and drought resilience programs via water use efficiency and smart irrigation management for crop production.}

  abstract = {Many environmental studies on the protection of European soil and water resources make use of soil water simulation models. A major obstacle to the wider application of these models is the lack of easily accessible and representative soil hydraulic properties. In order to overcome this apparent lack of data, a project was initiated to bring together the available hydraulic data which resided within different institutions in Europe into one central database. This information was then used to derive a set of pedotransfer functions applicable to studies at a European scale. These pedotransfer functions predict the hydraulic properties from parameters collected during soil surveys and can be a good alternative for costly and time-consuming direct measurement of these properties. A total of 20 institutions from 12 European countries collaborated in establishing the database of HYdraulic PRoperties of European Soils (HYPRES). This database has a flexible relational structure capable of holding a wide diversity of both soil pedological and hydraulic data. As these data were contributed by 20 different institutions it was necessary to standardise both the particle-size and the hydraulic data. A novel similarity interpolation procedure was successfully used to achieve standardization of particle-sizes according to the FAO clay, silt and sand particle-size ranges. Standardization of hydraulic data was achieved by fitting the Mualem-van Genuchten model parameters to the individual θ(h) and K(h) hydraulic properties stored in HYPRES. The HYPRES database contains information on a total of 5521 soil horizons (including replicates). Of these, 4030 horizons had sufficient data to be used in the derivation of pedotransfer functions. Information on both water retention and hydraulic conductivity was available for 1136 horizons whereas 2894 horizons had only information on water retention. Each soil horizon was allocated to one of 11 possible soil textural/pedological classes derived from the six FAO texture classes (five mineral and one organic) and the two pedological classes (topsoil and subsoil) recognised within the 1:1 000 000 scale Soil Geographical Data Base of Europe. Next, both class and continuous pedotransfer functions were developed. By using the class pedotransfer functions in combination with the 1:1 000 000 scale Soil Map of Europe, the spatial distribution of soil water availability within Europe was derived.}

  abstract  = {Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is the most widely used non-destructive method to determine the water content of soils and other porous media. TDR equipment can be automated and multiplexed to acquire accurate and rapid waveforms (return signal) without safety concerns associated with radioactive methods (e.g., neutron probe and Gamma-ray probe). Two key steps are required for TDR applications: (1) Obtain and analyze TDR waveforms using travel-time and signal attenuation analysis to determine dielectric permittivity and electrical conductivity, respectively. (2) Calibrate to determine a new- or apply an existing (e.g., Topp et al. (1980)) relationship between the derived soil dielectric permittivity and the volumetric water content of the porous medium of interest. A majority of researchers and practitioners focus on step two and additionally develop new mathematical models to get better estimates of water content. Although there are reviews of TDR principles and applications in soil science, there is a lack of information on how TDR can disclose critical information in porous media beyond average soil water content. Therefore, we present a newly expanded review of TDR applications in porous media including soils, plants, snow, food stuffs, and concrete. We begin by reviewing TDR basics, including principles, probe design, commercially available equipment, and graphical and numerical methods as well as available software for waveform analysis. Applications of TDR to estimate volumetric water content in various types of porous media, the latest techniques available to derive spatial variability of soil water distributions along a single TDR probe are included, followed by TDR waveform based analyses to estimate electrical conductivity (EC), wetting/drying and freezing/thawing fronts, and snow depth. The combination of TDR measurements coupled with other methods (e.g., gypsum/ceramics and heat pulse method) to determine a wide range of soil physical properties (e.g., soil water retention curve, thermal properties, and hydraulic conductivity) and fluxes (e.g., soil heat flux, liquid water flux, and vapor flux) are also included. The study concludes with a discussion of limitations and future perspectives on various TDR applications.}

In recent years, rapidly developed fiber-optic sensing technology has shown outstanding advantages, such as distributed measurement, long-distance monitoring, and good durability, which provides a new technical means for soil moisture field monitoring. After several years of technical research, the authors' group has made a number of new achievements in the development of fiber-optic sensing technology for the soil moisture field, that is, two new fiber-optic sensing technologies for soil moisture content, including the actively heated fiber Bragg grating (AH-FBG) technology and the actively heated distributed temperature sensing (AH-DTS) technology, and a new fiber-optic sensing technology for soil pore gas humidity are developed. This paper systematically summarizes the three fiber-optic sensing technologies for soil moisture field, including sensing principle, sensor development and calibration test. Moreover, the practical application cases of three fiber-optic sensing technologies are introduced. Finally, the development trend of fiber-optic sensing technology for soil moisture field in the future is summarized and prospected.}

  abstract = {The physical-based and machine learning (ML) models are two distinctive tools for predicting soil salt content (SSC). However, few studies have compared their performances, and it is yet unknown how they differ in terms of simulation accuracy at the field scale. To address this issue, based on a field experiment with sunflowers, a physical-based model and three ML models including distributed random forest (DRF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and deep learning (Deeplearning) were developed to predict SSC in two common scenarios (A and B). In Scenario A, the SSC was predicted using the training dataset in the in-situ field, while in Scenario B, the SSC was predicted with the training dataset from the other fields. Results show that the physical-based model remains an accurate tool to predict SSC; ML models hold a similar prediction capacity with specific algorithms and input variables. In Scenario A, with limited input variables of the initial status of SSC and related spatiotemporal information, the DRF model achieved better simulation accuracies (R2 higher by 0.05\textendash 0.37, NRMSE lower by 0\textendash 0.19) than the other two ML models. However, as more input variables were added, the simulation accuracies of the GBM model gradually improved (NRMSE decreased from 0.61 to 0.30) and eventually outperformed the DRF model. Although the variable importance was significant in the Deeplearning model, poor simulation performances were obtained in Scenario A; however, in Scenario B, the simulation accuracy of the Deeplearning model was higher than other ML models, especially for the SSC prediction at the deep soil and during the crop's late growth period, the median of the NRMSE boxplot approaching 0.31. These simulation results indicated the potential of ML models to substitute the physical-based model for SSC prediction. Still, the preferred ML model differs depending on the prediction scenarios and input variables.},

  abstract = {The water content in the soil regulates exchanges between soil and atmosphere, impacts plant livelihood, and determines the antecedent condition for several natural hazards. Accurate soil moisture estimates are key to applications such as natural hazard prediction, agriculture, and water management. We explore how to best predict soil moisture at a high resolution in the context of a changing climate. Physics-based hydrological models are promising as they provide distributed soil moisture estimates and allow prediction outside the range of prior observations. This is particularly important considering that the climate is changing, and the available historical records are often too short to capture extreme events. Unfortunately, these models are extremely computationally expensive, which makes their use challenging, especially when dealing with strong uncertainties. These characteristics make them complementary to machine learning approaches, which rely on training data quality/quantity but are typically computationally efficient. We first demonstrate the ability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to reproduce soil moisture fields simulated by the hydrological model ParFlow-CLM. Then, we show how these two approaches can be successfully combined to predict future droughts not seen in the historical timeseries. We do this by generating additional ParFlow-CLM simulations with altered forcing mimicking future drought scenarios. Comparing the performance of CNN models trained on historical forcing and CNN models trained also on simulations with altered forcing reveals the potential of combining these two approaches. The CNN can not only reproduce the moisture response to a given forcing but also learn and predict the impact of altered forcing. Given the uncertainties in projected climate change, we can create a limited number of representative ParFlow-CLM simulations (ca. 25 min/water year on 9 CPUs for our case study), train our CNNs, and use them to efficiently (seconds/water-year on 1 CPU) predict additional water years/scenarios and improve our understanding of future drought potential. This framework allows users to explore scenarios beyond past observation and tailor the training data to their application of interest (e.g., wet conditions for flooding, dry conditions for drought, etc\ldots ). With the trained ML model they can rely on high resolution soil moisture estimates and explore the impact of uncertainties.}

  abstract = {Soil moisture plays a critical role as an essential component of the global water resources by regulating mass and energy exchange between land surface and atmosphere. Quantification of these exchange processes requires accurate characterization and simulation of soil water movement. Physically-based models (PBMs) and machine learning methods (MLMs) can both be used in soil moisture simulation. However, their performances in soil water simulation have only been compared in a limited number of cases. Moreover, almost all of them are conducted in field studies each with fixed soil, initial condition, and boundary condition. Here, we developed three artificial neural network (ANN) frameworks, and made clearer and more systematic comparisons between them and a PBM\textemdash Ross numerical model solving Richards equation and parameter estimation using a data assimilation approach (iterative ensemble smoother, Ross-IES) in synthetic and real-world conditions. Compared with the ANNs, Ross-IES is more significantly affected by physical model uncertainties such as soil heterogeneity, initial and boundary conditions, while both methods are affected by observation noise. For Ross-IES, the errors from boundary conditions and hydraulic parameter conceptualization are found to be more prominent than that of observation noise and therefore are suggested to be identified first. Meanwhile, the ANNs have difficulty in simulating the peaks and troughs of the soil water time series as well as in situations where the soil moisture is constantly saturated. ANNs yield a superior simulation when the nonlinear relationship between the response variables and driving data is weak, while the performance of Ross-IES is governed by the prior soil hydraulic information. In addition, Ross-IES approach requires much higher computational cost than the ANNs. ANN-MS performs best among the three ANN-based machine learning models and demonstrates great data mining ability and robustness against overfitting.},

SWAP is used by researchers, engineers and students in the field of environmental science. Researchers employ the interactions between soil, water, plant and atmosphere as simulated by SWAP and the easy way in which the model can be adapted to specific research questions. Environmental engineers use the model as published and employ the practical boundary conditions of the model. In education SWAP is used to demonstrate typical transport situations in the biosphere. Students, ranging from Bachelor to PhD level, practice with the model. Some PhD students use SWAP as a research platform, to which they add innovative concepts. At Wageningen University and Research centre fundamental and applied research are closely entangled. Scientists and students of various environmental disciplines and from all continents collaborate intensively. This creates much synergy, of which SWAP is one of the products. Since the last release in 2009 a large number of new ideas have been tested with SWAP. Currently in environmental research much attention is paid to the food-water-energy nexus. In this research interaction between soil hydrology and crop growth plays a key role. In WaterVision (Hack\textendash ten Broeke et al., 2016) we bring together the Dutch experience on how crop growth is affected by soil, climate and stresses due to lack of oxygen, water or due to excess of salts. In the frame of WaterVision we release this new SWAP standard version in which we implemented versatile improvements of recent years. Our exciting journey does not end here. The future will bring new challenges. Therefore we supply SWAP with a well-structured source code and invite users to implement and test their own ideas.

  abstract  = {Being one of the key factor in designing and managing the drip irrigation system, moisture profile is essential for optimization of spacing of emitters as well as laterals. The experiments include surface drip irrigation system having three discharges viz., 2 lph, 4.4 lph and 6 lph conducted in farms of pump and Wells laboratory shed of College of Agricultural Engineering, Samastipur, Bihar. The experiment was managed in a metallic cylindrical tank having suitable dimensions which was full of soil. The experiments were conducted by drip emitters of different discharge rates and the tenacity of moisture in soil for different discharge was measures with tensiometer. Contour maps were plotted from the data recorded during the experiment for different discharge rates of 2 lph, 4.4 lph and 6 lph using the Surfer \textendash{} 7 software. The experiment concluded that the horizontal spread of water increases with increase in discharge of emitter. The horizontal spread was observed to be about 23.3\% and 43.3\% more when the emitter discharge rate increased from 2 lph to 4.4 lph and 6.0 lph respectively. The vertical spread of water decreases with increase in emitter discharge rate. The vertical spread was observed to be about 18.0\% and 32.0\% less when discharge was increased from 2 lph to 4.4 lph and 6.0 lph respectively.}

Moisture losses after storage of samples in two different containers for periods up to 7 days are shown to be negligible. Aluminium foil is recommended as a very inexpensive and efficient container. As the rate and length of drying needed for different soils is quite variable, preliminary investigations should be undertaken to establish the times after which negligible losses occur for further periods of drying. In most field studies samples of 50\textendash 100 g of soil are adequate; larger samples of 500 g require much longer periods of drying but give similar results. Methodological problems discussed include the site destruction caused by the gravimetric method and the fact that the method itself accounts for some of the variability found in soil moisture distribution, and possibly for supposedly significant changes in soil moisture content in time and space.}

The probe consists of a dumbbell-shape magnet and an opposed-solenoid RF (radio frequency) coil. Optimization methods for the structure of the magnet and RF coil that maximize the SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) of NMR measurements are also described. The dumbbell-shape magnet consists of three cylindrical magnets in series whose magnetic field was calculated with analytic expression deduced by converting magnet to equivalent magnetization current on its cylindrical surface. Based on the analytic expression, a nonlinear optimization mathematical model was built to determine the optimal structure parameters automatically. The opposed-solenoid is a pair of reverse-connected solenoids and used as RF coil on inside-out NMR probe in this work. Its structure-parameter optimization was carried out based on FEM (finite element method) simulation, and UD (uniform design) was applied to increase the optimization efficiency. A prototype was designed and built consisting of a magnet with length of 100 mm and a diameter of 40 mm. An NMR-based soil moisture measuring experiment was conducted by this prototype, with NMR performed using the CPMG (Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill) pulse sequence for soil sample in different moisture content. The T2 distribution spectrum reveals that there are two compartments of water in the soil sample: free water and bound water.}

The key to TDR's success is its ability to accurately measure the permittivity of a material and the fact that there is a good relationship between the permittivity of a material and its water content. A further advantage is the ability to estimate water content and measure bulk soil EC simultaneously using TDR. The aim of this review is to summarize and examine advances that have been made in terms of measuring permittivity and bulk EC. The review examines issues such as the effective frequency of the TDR measurement and waveform analysis in dispersive dielectrics. The growing importance of both waveform simulation and inverse analysis of waveforms is highlighted. Such methods hold great potential for obtaining far more information from TDR waveform analysis. Probe design is considered in some detail and practical guidance is given for probe construction. The importance of TDR measurement sampling volume is considered and the relative energy storage density is modeled for a range of probe designs. Tables are provided that compare some of the different aspects of commercial TDR equipment, and the units are discussed in terms of their performance and their advantages and disadvantages. It is hoped that the review will provide an informative guide to the more technical aspects of permittivity and EC measurement using TDR for the novice and expert alike.}},

  abstract = {A new approach to estimate soil moisture (SM) based on evaporative fraction (EF) retrieved from optical/thermal infrared MODIS data is presented for Canadian Prairies in parts of Saskatchewan and Alberta. An EF model using the remotely sensed land surface temperature (Ts)/vegetation index concept was modified by incorporating North American Regional Reanalysis (NAAR) Ta data and used for SM estimation. Two different combinations of temperature and vegetation fraction using the difference between Ts from MODIS Aqua and Terra images and Ta from NARR data (Ts−Ta Aqua-day and Ts−Ta Terra-day, respectively) were proposed and the results were compared with those obtained from a previously improved model (ΔTs Aqua-DayNight) as a reference. For the estimation of SM from EF, two empirical models were tested and discussed to find the most appropriate model for converting MODIS-derived EF data to SM values. Estimated SM values were then correlated with in situ SM measurements and their relationships were statistically analyzed. Results indicated statistically significant correlations between SM estimated from all three EF estimation approaches and field measured SM values (R2=0.42–0.77, p values<0.04) exhibiting the possibility to estimate SM from remotely sensed EF models. The proposed Ts−Ta MODIS Aqua-day and Terra-day approaches resulted in better estimations of SM (on average higher R2 values and similar RMSEs) as compared with the ΔTs reference approach indicating that the concept of incorporating NARR Ta data into Ts/Vegetation index model improved soil moisture estimation accuracy based on evaporative fraction. The accuracies of the predictions were found to be considerably better for intermediate SM values (from 12 to 22vol/vol%) with square errors averaging below 11 (vol/vol%)2. This indicates that the model needs further improvements to account for extreme soil moisture conditions. The findings of this research can be potentially used to downscale SM estimations obtained from passive microwave remote sensing techniques.}

  abstract = {The need for improvements in the water use efficiency by agricultural ecosystems requires a holistic assessment of the hydraulic functioning of cropped soils, taking into consideration the most relevant interactions and feedbacks that control the soil water budget. We implemented a mechanistic approach to isolate the effects of soil hydraulic properties (K-θ-h) of layered soils on water balance components and land and water productivity, adopting comprehensive scenarios of soil water availability and requirements. The agro-hydrological simulations were performed using the SWAP model integrated with the WOFOST crop growth module. The simulated scenarios included the rainfed crop growth of maize and soybean in three climate zones, evaluating the current climate scenarios as well as two future scenarios, a wetter and a drier one, totaling 108 scenarios simulated for 30 years each. Simulations were performed for six soils, grouped pairwise (3 × 2), where each pair represented the same soil group with two different long-term land uses: natural forest (proxy of a no-tillage system) and conventional agricultural use. The K-θ-h relationships were obtained simultaneously by inverse modeling for the full range of soil water contents commonly found in the domain of crop available water. The agro-hydrological simulations showed that the soil hydraulic properties affect dynamically water balance components and land productivity by relating soil hydraulic functioning to climate patterns and crop water requirements. In general, maize productivity was more sensitive to soil hydraulic properties under future climate scenarios than soybean. While land productivities of maize and soybean increased under the wetter climate scenario, water productivity of both crops was consistently reduced by both future climate scenarios. The K-θ-h of soils under conventional agricultural use over-performed their counterparts under long-term natural forest use, especially regarding land productivity during growing seasons with pronounced dry spells. Depending on the length and timing of drought stress during the growing season, the yield response is determined by soil-specific conditions strictly related to water availability. The long-term average revealed that the sampled loamy sand soils have more favorable hydraulic properties for crop growth; moreover, the reduced unproductive water losses, especially runoff, increased the dynamic water storage of those soils.}

  abstract = {Water retention and hydraulic conductivity are crucial input parameters in any modelling study on water flow and solute transport in soils. Due to inherent temporal and spatial variability in these hydraulic characteristics, large numbers of samples are required to properly characterise areas of land. Hydraulic characteristics can be obtained from direct laboratory and field measurements. However, these measurements are time consuming which makes it costly to characterise an area of land. As an alternative, analysis of existing databases of measured soil hydraulic data may result in pedotransfer functions. In practise, these functions often prove to be good predictors for missing soil hydraulic characteristics. Examples are presented of different equations describing hydraulic characteristics and of pedotransfer functions used to predict parameters in these equations. Grouping of data prior to pedotransfer function development is discussed as well as the use of different soil properties as predictors. In addition to regression analysis, new techniques such as artificial neural networks, group methods of data handling, and classification and regression trees are increasingly being used for pedotransfer function development. Actual development of pedotransfer functions is demonstrated by describing a practical case study. Examples are presented of pedotransfer function for predicting other than hydraulic characteristics. Accuracy and reliability of pedotransfer functions are demonstrated and discussed. In this respect, functional evaluation of pedotransfer functions proves to be a good tool to assess the desired accuracy of a pedotransfer function for a specific application.}

This paper reviews the development of pedotransfer functions (PTFs) used as an alternative tool to estimate soil hydraulic properties during the last two decades. Modern soil survey techniques like satellite imagery/remote sensing has been used in developing PTFs. Compared to mechanistic approaches, empirical relationships between physical properties and hydraulic properties have received wide preference for predicting soil hydraulic properties. Many PTFs based on different parametric functions can be found in the literature. A number of researchers have pursued a universal function that can describe water retention characteristics of all types of soils, but no single function can be termed generic though van Genuchten (VG) function has been the most widely adopted. Most of the reported parametric PTFs focus on estimation of VG parameters to obtain water retention curve (WRC). A number of physical, morphological and chemical properties have been used as predictor variables in PTFs. Conventionally, regression algorithms/techniques (statistical/neural regression) have been used for calibrating PTFs. However, there are reports of utilizing data mining techniques, e.g., pattern recognition and genetic algorithm. It is inferred that it is critical to refine the data used for calibration to improve the accuracy and reliability of the PTFs. Many statistical indices, including root mean square error (RMSE), index of agreement (d), maximum absolute error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (r2) and correlation coefficient (r), have been used by different researchers to evaluate and validate PTFs. It is argued that being location specific, research interest in PTFs will continue till generic PTFs are developed and validated. In future studies, improved methods will be required to extract information from the existing database.}

  abstract = {Feature selection is a valuable technique in data analysis for information-preserving data reduction. This paper describes Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and Multivariate Regression Trees (MRT)-based approaches for both supervised and unsupervised feature selection. The well-known CART method allows to perform supervised feature selection by modeling one response variable (y) by some explanatory variables (x). The recently proposed CART extension, MRT can handle more than one response variable (y). This allows to perform a supervised feature selection in the presence of more than one response variable. For unsupervised feature selection, where no response variables are available, we propose Auto-Associative Multivariate Regression Trees (AAMRT) where the original variables (x) are not only used as explanatory variables (x), but also as response variables (y=x). Since (AA)MRT is grouping the objects into groups with similar response values by using explanatory variables, this means that the variables are found which are most responsible for the cluster structure in the data. We will demonstrate how these approaches can improve (the detection of) the cluster structure in data and how they can be used for knowledge discovery.},

XGBoost is a scalable ensemble technique that has demonstrated to be a reliable and efficient machine learning challenge solver.

CatBoost modifies the computation of gradients to avoid the prediction shift in order to improve the accuracy of the model. This work proposes a practical analysis of how these novel variants of gradient boosting work in terms of training speed, generalization performance and hyper-parameter setup. In addition, a comprehensive comparison between XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, random forests and gradient boosting has been performed using carefully tuned models as well as using their default settings. The results of this comparison indicate that CatBoost obtains the best results in generalization accuracy and AUC in the studied datasets although the differences are small. LightGBM is the fastest of all methods but not the most accurate. Finally, XGBoost places second both in accuracy and in training speed. Finally an extensive analysis of the effect of hyper-parameter tuning in XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost is carried out using two novel proposed tools.},

  abstract   = {ABSTRACT: Herein, a recently developed methodology, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), is presented and applied to the challenge of soil moisture prediction. Support Vector Machines are derived from statistical learning theory and can be used to predict a quantity forward in time based on training that uses past data, hence providing a statistically sound approach to solving inverse problems. The principal strength of SVMs lies in the fact that they employ Structural Risk Minimization (SRM) instead of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). The SVMs formulate a quadratic optimization problem that ensures a global optimum, which makes them superior to traditional learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The resulting model is sparse and not characterized by the ``curse of dimensionality.'' Soil moisture distribution and variation is helpful in predicting and understanding various hydrologic processes, including weather changes, energy and moisture fluxes, drought, irrigation scheduling, and rainfall/runoff generation. Soil moisture and meteorological data are used to generate SVM predictions for four and seven days ahead. Predictions show good agreement with actual soil moisture measurements. Results from the SVM modeling are compared with predictions obtained from ANN models and show that SVM models performed better for soil moisture forecasting than ANN models.},

In this paper, evaporation, ground temperature, precipitation, air pressure, sunshine hours, air temperature and wind speed are taken as independent variables to analyze the Spelman correlation with soil moisture, and the correlation between each variable and soil moisture change is obtained.

The soil moisture prediction model of BAS-BP is compared with different prediction models of GA-BP and BP. The results show that the average absolute error and average relative error of BAS-BP are 9.1936 and 0.1333 respectively, which is lower than that of GA-BP and BP model. The shortcomings of long training time and slow convergence speed are overcome by BAS-BP neural network, and the accuracy of prediction is improved.},

  abstract = {Prognostic prediction of soil moisture is a critical step in various fields such as geotechnical engineering, agriculture, geology, hydrology, and climatology. For example, in agricultural applications, soil moisture prediction is needed one-day and one-week ahead of time to optimize crop planting quality and set irrigation schedule, respectively. In soil and environmental management applications, soil moisture prediction is usually needed one-month ahead of time. Therefore, a capability to accurately forecast soil moisture is of paramount importance. For this purpose, deep learning methods, especially the long short-term memory network (LSTM) method, have been used extensively. It is shown that such models can successfully forecast the soil moisture for a short time frame in future, but their accuracy sharply decreases for long time frames. To resolve this issue, in this study, we present a multihead LSTM model that learns a number of hypotheses and aggregates them for prognostic prediction tasks. The multihead LSTM model is comprised of four LSTM models that digest time series data of soil moisture aggregated at different scales as inputs. The outputs of these models, i.e., predicted soil moisture at a certain time in future, are then combined using a weighted averaging method to obtain the final prediction values. Different statistical measures, such as the root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and R-squared are employed to assess the performance of the multihead LSTM model predictions against the ground truth. The results show that the proposed multihead LSTM method is effective to forecast the soil moisture up to one-month in future with a R-squared value of 95.04\%.},

However, soil moisture involves complex structural characteristics and meteorological factors, and it is difficult to establish an ideal mathematical model for soil moisture prediction. Existing prediction models have problems such as prediction accuracy, generalization, and multi-feature processing capability, and prediction performance must improve. Based on this, taking the Beijing area as the research object, the deep learning regression network (DNNR) with big data fitting capability was proposed to construct a soil moisture prediction model. By integrating the dataset, analyzing the time series of the predictive variables, and clarifying the relationship between features and predictive variables through the Taylor diagram, selected meteorological parameters can provide effective weights for moisture prediction. Test results prove that the deep learning model is feasible and effective for soil moisture prediction. Its' good data fitting and generalization capability can enrich the input characteristics while ensuring high accuracy in predicting the trends and values of soil moisture data and provides an effective theoretical basis for water-saving irrigation and drought control.},

  abstract  = {Soil moisture is an integral quantity parameter in hydrology and agriculture practices. Satellite remote sensing has been widely applied to estimate surface soil moisture. However, it is still a challenge to retrieve surface soil moisture content (SMC) data in the heterogeneous catchment at high spatial resolution. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the retrieval of SMC from remote sensing data, which is important in the planning and efficient use of land resources. Many methods based on satellite-derived vegetation indices have already been developed to estimate SMC in various climatic and geographic conditions. Soil moisture retrievals were performed using statistical and machine learning methods as well as physical modeling techniques. In this study, an important experiment of soil moisture retrieval for investigating the capability of the machine learning methods was conducted in the early spring season in a semi-arid region of Iran. We applied random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and elastic net regression (EN) algorithms to soil moisture retrieval by optical and thermal sensors of Landsat 8 and knowledge of land-use types on previously untested conditions in a semi-arid region of Iran. The statistical comparisons show that RF method provided the highest Nash\textendash Sutcliffe efficiency value (0.73) for soil moisture retrieval covered by the different land-use types. Combinations of surface reflectance and auxiliary geospatial data can provide more valuable information for SMC estimation, which shows promise for precision agriculture applications.},

We tested four different machine learning algorithms. The boosted regression tree algorithm provided the best accuracy model with mean absolute error of 3.8 \% volumetric water content. The most important variables for the prediction of soil moisture were precipitation, reflectance in the red wavelengths, potential evapotranspiration, and topographic position indices (TPI). Our results demonstrate that the dynamics of soil water status across heterogeneous terrain may be adequately described and predicted by UAS remote sensing data and machine learning. Our modeling approach and the variable importance and relationships we have assessed in this study should be useful for management and environmental modeling tasks where spatially explicit soil moisture information is important.}

Remote-sensing offers the unique possibility for continuous measurements of this variable. Especially for agriculture, there is a strong demand for high spatial resolution mapping. However, operationally available soil moisture products exist with medium to coarse spatial resolution only ({$\geq$}1 km). This study introduces a machine learning (ML)\textemdash based approach for the high spatial resolution (50 m) mapping of soil moisture based on the integration of Landsat-8 optical and thermal images, Copernicus Sentinel-1 C-Band SAR images, and modelled data, executable in the Google Earth Engine. The novelty of this approach lies in applying an entirely data-driven ML concept for global estimation of the surface soil moisture content. Globally distributed in situ data from the International Soil Moisture Network acted as an input for model training. Based on the independent validation dataset, the resulting overall estimation accuracy, in terms of Root-Mean-Squared-Error and R{$^2$}, was 0.04 m3{$\cdot$}m-3 and 0.81, respectively. Beyond the retrieval model itself, this article introduces a framework for collecting training data and a stand-alone Python package for soil moisture mapping. The Google Earth Engine Python API facilitates the execution of data collection and retrieval which is entirely cloud-based.

  abstract  = {The infiltration of water into the soil can lead to slope instability, which is one of the important causes of many geological hazards (such as landslides and debris flows). Therefore, the numerical investigation of the soil\textendash water infiltration process provides the prerequisite for the determination of slope stability, which is of great significance for geological hazard prevention. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based approach for a numerical investigation of soil\textendash water vertical infiltration with physics-informed neural networks and perform a comprehensive evaluation and analysis of the soil\textendash water infiltration process in different soil types. In the proposed approach, the partial differential equation for soil\textendash water infiltration is combined with the neural network based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to obtain numerical analysis of the soil\textendash water infiltration process. The results indicate that (1) compared with the traditional numerical method, the PINN-based method for the numerical investigation of soil\textendash water vertical infiltration proposed in this study has a smaller error and can obtain more accurate numerical results. (2) During vertical infiltration of water in the different soil types, the light loam is the fastest, the heavy-loam the second and the medium loam the slowest. medium-loam soils are less susceptible to water infiltration of the three soil types and are more suitable for the filling of artificial slopes and dams. The proposed approach could be employed for the simulation of soil\textendash water infiltration processes, not only for the discrimination of slope stability under rainfall conditions, but also for the selection of artificial slopes and dams to fill soil to prevent slope instability.},

  abstract   = {Core Ideas A community effort is needed to move soil modeling forward. Establishing an international soil modeling consortium is key in this respect. There is a need to better integrate existing knowledge in soil models. Integration of data and models is a key challenge in soil modeling. The remarkable complexity of soil and its importance to a wide range of ecosystem services presents major challenges to the modeling of soil processes. Although major progress in soil models has occurred in the last decades, models of soil processes remain disjointed between disciplines or ecosystem services, with considerable uncertainty remaining in the quality of predictions and several challenges that remain yet to be addressed. First, there is a need to improve exchange of knowledge and experience among the different disciplines in soil science and to reach out to other Earth science communities. Second, the community needs to develop a new generation of soil models based on a systemic approach comprising relevant physical, chemical, and biological processes to address critical knowledge gaps in our understanding of soil processes and their interactions. Overcoming these challenges will facilitate exchanges between soil modeling and climate, plant, and social science modeling communities. It will allow us to contribute to preserve and improve our assessment of ecosystem services and advance our understanding of climate-change feedback mechanisms, among others, thereby facilitating and strengthening communication among scientific disciplines and society. We review the role of modeling soil processes in quantifying key soil processes that shape ecosystem services, with a focus on provisioning and regulating services. We then identify key challenges in modeling soil processes, including the systematic incorporation of heterogeneity and uncertainty, the integration of data and models, and strategies for effective integration of knowledge on physical, chemical, and biological soil processes. We discuss how the soil modeling community could best interface with modern modeling activities in other disciplines, such as climate, ecology, and plant research, and how to weave novel observation and measurement techniques into soil models. We propose the establishment of an international soil modeling consortium to coherently advance soil modeling activities and foster communication with other Earth science disciplines. Such a consortium should promote soil modeling platforms and data repository for model development, calibration and intercomparison essential for addressing contemporary challenges.},

In the context of smart farming, grower combine information from sensors located close to their crops with agronomic models to help them to better understand their crops. Irrigation management is therefore based on extrapolation of data and/or agronomic model responses. This problem can be seen as a learning task for which machine learning techniques have proven their relevance in many and diverse applications. In this paper we place ourselves in the context of potato farming, a crop for which irrigation plays a crucial role. We model the problem of soil water potential prediction as a learning problem solved by supervised leaning algorithms. The problem appears to be difficult since there are several potential inputs, and several outputs to predict. Experiments are conducted on several scenarios with data acquired during 3~years. We demonstrate the possibility of applying feature selection method to automatically design models with features relevant to the problem at hand while having good performances. We have also demonstrated the relevance of the machine learning for this kind of problem, since the methods are able to correctly predict the next water potential values.},

Here, we investigated a deep learning approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for predicting the severity of language disorder from 3D lesion images from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a heterogeneous sample of stroke patients. CNN performance was compared to that of conventional (shallow) machine learning methods, including ridge regression (RR) on the images' principal components and support vector regression. We also devised a hybrid method based on re-using CNN's high-level features as additional input to the RR model. Predictive accuracy of the four different methods was further investigated in relation to the size of the training set and the level of redundancy across lesion images in the dataset, which was evaluated in terms of location and topological properties of the lesions. The Hybrid model achieved the best performance in most cases, thereby suggesting that the high-level features extracted by CNNs are complementary to principal component analysis features and improve the model's predictive accuracy. Moreover, our analyses indicate that both the size of training data and image redundancy are critical factors in determining the accuracy of a computational model in predicting behavioral outcome from the structural brain imaging data of stroke patients.},

The vis-NIR spectroscopy research enthusiasm around the world has created regional to global soil spectral libraries. While machine learning methods have been utilised in processing spectral data, such large regional datasets are better dealt with big data analytics. Deep learning is an exciting discipline that has already transformed the way data are analysed in many fields and could also change the way we model soil spectral data. This study developed and evaluated convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning algorithm, as a new way to predict soil properties from raw soil spectra. We demonstrated the effectiveness of CNNs on the LUCAS soil database, which consists of around 20,000 topsoil observations with physicochemical and biological properties from Europe. To fully utilise the capacity of the CNN model, we represented the soil spectral data as a 2-dimensional spectrogram, showing the reflectance as a function of wavelength and frequency. We showed the capacity of a CNN to be trained in a multi-task setting to simultaneously predict six soil properties in one model (OC, CEC, clay, sand, pH, total N). Compared with conventional methods such as PLS regression and Cubist regression tree, the CNN performed significantly better, especially the multi-tasking model. In the case of soil organic carbon prediction, the multi-task CNN decreased the error by 87\% compared to PLS and 62\% compared with Cubist. This approach proved to be effective when trained on a relatively large dataset. The high accuracy of CNN makes it an ideal tool for modelling soil spectral data.},

  abstract  = {Although numerous satellite-based soil moisture (SM) products can provide spatiotemporally continuous worldwide datasets, they can hardly be employed in characterizing fine-grained regional land surface processes, owing to their coarse spatial resolution. In this study, we proposed a machine-learning-based method to enhance SM spatial accuracy and improve the availability of SM data. Four machine learning algorithms, including classification and regression trees (CART), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Bayesian (BAYE), and random forests (RF), were implemented to downscale the monthly European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) SM product from 25-km to 1-km spatial resolution. During the regression, the land surface temperature (including daytime temperature, nighttime temperature, and diurnal fluctuation temperature), normalized difference vegetation index, surface reflections (red band, blue band, NIR band and MIR band), and digital elevation model were taken as explanatory variables to produce fine spatial resolution SM. We chose Northeast China as the study area and acquired corresponding SM data from 2003 to 2012 in unfrozen seasons. The reconstructed SM datasets were validated against in-situ measurements. The results showed that the RF-downscaled results had superior matching performance to both ESA CCI SM and in-situ measurements, and can positively respond to precipitation variation. Additionally, the RF was less affected by parameters, which revealed its robustness. Both CART and KNN ranked second. Compared to KNN, CART had a relatively close correlation with the validation data, but KNN showed preferable precision. Moreover, BAYE ranked last with significantly abnormal regression values.},

  abstract = {The skillful soil moisture (SM) for the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) L4 product can provide substantial value for many practical applications including ecosystem management and precision agriculture. Deep learning (DL) models provide powerful methods for hydrologic variables' prediction such as SM. However, the sample size of daily SM in the SMAP product is quite small, which may lead to overfitting and further impact the accuracy of DL models. From this, we first tested whether excellent predictive performance can be achieved with limited SMAP samples by the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) models, which are frequent used for hydrologic prediction. Then we pre-trained the DL models in the source domain (ERA5-land) and fine-tuned them in the target domain (SMAP). The results show that the transfer ConvLSTM model had the highest R2 ranging from 0.909 to 0.916 and the lowest RMSE ranging from 0.0239 to 0.0247 for the lead time of 3, 5 and 7~days, and the regression lines between the predicted and the observed SM were closer to the ideal line (y~=~x) than all the other DL models. All the performances of transfer DL models were better than those of their corresponding DL models without transfer learning and some regions witnessed an increased explained variation over 20\%. The predictive ability of different factors (i.e., lagged SM, soil temperature, season, and precipitation) has been widely discussed in this paper. According the results, we advocate for applying cross-source transfer learning with DL models for SM prediction in newly built datasets.},

The increasing availability of soil data that can be efficiently acquired remotely and proximally, and freely available open-source algorithms, have led to an accelerated adoption of ML techniques to analyse soil data. Given the large number of publications, it is an impossible task to manually review all papers on the application of ML in soil science without narrowing down a narrative of ML application in a specific research question. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the application of ML techniques in soil science aided by a ML algorithm (latent Dirichlet allocation) to find patterns in a large collection of text corpora. The objective is to gain insight into publications of ML applications in soil science and to discuss the research gaps in this topic. We found that (a) there is an increasing usage of ML methods in soil sciences, mostly concentrated in developed countries, (b) the reviewed publications can be grouped into 12 topics, namely remote sensing, soil organic carbon, water, contamination, methods (ensembles), erosion and parent material, methods (NN, neural networks, SVM, support vector machines), spectroscopy, modelling (classes), crops, physical, and modelling (continuous), and (c) advanced ML methods usually perform better than simpler approaches thanks to their capability to capture non-linear relationships. From these findings, we found research gaps, in particular, about the precautions that should be taken (parsimony) to avoid overfitting, and that the interpretability of the ML models is an important aspect to consider when applying advanced ML methods in order to improve our knowledge and understanding of soil. We foresee that a large number of studies will focus on the latter topic.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

There is need to create relation among these parameters to deduce soil water content as to limit cost of introducing sensors. The present investigation means to measure the progression of these four parameters in a green infrastructure site in an urban landscape and to additionally create correlations among them. An incorporated field testing and statistical modeling approach is embraced to accomplish the objective. Four sites including bare, grassed and treed soil are chosen for examination. Field monitoring was first directed to monitor the above mentioned four parameters for two months. This is trailed by statistical modeling using artificial intelligence (AI) approach (i.e., artificial neutral networks (ANN)). Correlations are created for evaluating soil water content as function of EC, RH and temperature for the four sites. Regardless of the sort of cover, EC is strongly correlated to soil water content, followed by RH and soil temperature. The correlation of EC is strongest in vegetated soil when compared with bare soil. The relationship of soil temperature with water content of soil do not have a decisive pattern. Ensuring drying of soils does not increase temperature fundamentally after precipitation. Uncertainty investigation additionally presumes that water content of soil follows normal distribution function in treed soils, while it follows skewed distribution in the cases of grassed and bare soils.},

In this paper, we review recent contributions within the Continuous Optimization and the Mixed-Integer Linear Optimization paradigms to develop novel formulations in this research area. We compare those in terms of the nature of the decision variables and the constraints required, as well as the optimization algorithms proposed. We illustrate how these powerful formulations enhance the flexibility of tree models, being better suited to incorporate desirable properties such as cost-sensitivity, explainability, and fairness, and to deal with complex data, such as functional data.},

  abstract   = {Soil water content is a key parameter for representing water dynamics in soils. Its prediction is fundamental for different practical applications, such as identifying shallow landslides triggering. Support vector machine (SVM) is a machine learning technique, which can be used to predict the temporal trend of a quantity since training from past data. SVM was applied to a test slope of Oltrep\`o Pavese (northern Italy), where meteorological parameters coupled with soil water content at different depths (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4 m) were measured. Two SVM models were developed for water content assessment: (i) model 1, considering rainfall amount, air temperature, air humidity, net solar radiation, and wind speed; (ii) model 2, considering the same predictors of model 1 together with antecedent condition parameters (cumulated rainfall of 7, 30, and 60 days; mean air temperature of 7, 30, and 60 days). SVM model 2 showed significantly higher satisfactory results than model 1, for both training and test phases and for all the considered soil levels. SVM models trends were implemented in a methodology of slope safety factor assessment. For a real event occurred in the tested slope, the triggering time was correctly predicted using data estimated by SVM model based on antecedent meteorological conditions. This confirms the necessity of including these predictors for building a SVM technique able to estimate correctly soil moisture dynamics in time. The results of this paper show a promising potential application of the SVM methodologies for modeling soil moisture required in slope stability analysis.},

  abstract = {Quantifying the spatial and temporal dynamics of soil moisture is an important subject in vadose zone hydrology. A 1282-day field study was conducted to provide a hierarchy of data to assess neural network simulations of field soil water content time series \texttheta (t). Volumetric water content was determined, typically once a week, by neutron thermalization at 20-, 40-, 60-, 80- and 100-cm depths. Soil samples were taken at 60 locations between 14- and 114-cm depths to determine soil properties, water retention, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Prediction of hydraulic parameters from basic and extended soil properties yielded low correlation coefficients. Water content could be predicted reasonably with neural networks from soil properties or hydraulic parameters (0.880~{$<~$}R~{$<~$}0.942). Prediction of \texttheta (t) based solely on rainfall data was not accurate. Independent networks could accurately simulate water content from one observed \texttheta (t) based on the Nash-Sutcliffe Model Efficiency and Percent Bias. Once a network is trained for a particular depth, accurate predictions can be made beyond the training period using observations at just one location.},

  abstract   = {Accurate estimation of soil moisture content is necessary for optimal management of water and soil resources. Soil moisture is an important variable in the hydrologic cycle, which plays an important role in the global water and energy balance due to its impact on hydrological, ecological, and meteorological processes. The purpose of the present study was to explore a newly developed hybrid intelligent model for simulating soil moisture content. A hybrid adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model-grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm was designed here and validated against the neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR) and standalone ANFIS models. The models input parameters were di-electric constant, soil bulk density, clay content and organic matter of 1155 soil samples. Various statistical indices were employed to evaluate the performances of the applied models. For a reliable ranking of models, the Global Performance Indicator (GPI) was utilized, which is a 5-agent index. The results evidenced the feasibility of the developed hybrid ANFIS-GWO model with superior simulation results. At the testing stage, the MAE and SI values for the ANFIS-GWO were 1.468\% and 0.098, respectively, which indicated the superiority of the ANFIS-GWO compared to the ANFIS-Fuzzy C mean (MAE\,=\,6.427\%, SI\,=\,0.354), and ANFIS-sub clustering (MAE\,=\,2.137\%, SI\,=\,0.141) models. Based on the GPI, the ANFIS-GWO model was ranked as the best model, followed by the standalone ANFIS and SVR models, while the worst accuracy was attained through ANN model. The ANFIS-GWO model improved the simulation accuracy by 48\% and 50\%, respectively, compared to the standalone ANFIS and SVR models. In addition, based on the GPI, the ANFIS-GWO model presented an enhancement of about 77 percent compared to the ANN model. The high accuracy of the ANFIS-GWO model compared to the standalone ANFIS model represents the performance of the GWO algorithm for escaping local optima, which makes the ANFIS-GWO as a powerful tool for estimating soil moisture. Overall, the explored hybrid intelligent models demonstrated a reliable pedotransfer function of soil moisture where it can contribute to several geo-sciences engineering principles.},

  abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) is a significant factor in the climate system. The accurate determination of SM has high importance in food production to satisfy the increasing demand for food and the chemical processes of soil. This paper applies decision tree regression to estimate SM considering different parameters including air temperature, time, relative humidity, and soil temperature. The presented method holds a mighty advantage to determine SM since the stimulant of the decision tree regression is an algorithm that generates a decision tree from given instances. Besides, usage of decision tree regression provides an opportunity to save time. Numerical results show that the presented method offers a high coefficient of determination value (R2), low mean squared error (MSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The depth of the decision tree equals to five by providing higher fitness values than other depth levels. The best fitness values in the training stage are 0.00019, 0.007, and 0.842 for MSE, MAE, and~R2, respectively. In conclusion of the paper, applied decision tree regression can handle the data of SM estimation in satisfying fitness criterion.},

Land-surface models can provide a valuable alternative for simulating soil moisture dynamics, but only a few countries have such modelling schemes implemented for monitoring soil moisture at high spatial resolution. In this study, a soil moisture accounting model (SMA) was regionalized over the Iberian Peninsula, taking as a reference the soil moisture simulated by a high-resolution land-surface model. To estimate the soil water holding capacity, the sole parameter required to run the SMA model, two approaches were compared: the direct estimation from European soil maps using pedotransfer functions or an indirect estimation by a machine learning approach, random forests, using as predictors altitude, temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and land use. Results showed that the random forest model estimates are more robust, especially for estimating low soil moisture levels. Consequently, the proposed approach can provide an efficient way to simulate daily soil moisture and therefore monitor soil moisture droughts, in contexts where high-resolution soil maps are not available, as it relies on a set of covariates that can be reliably estimated from global databases.{$<$}/p{$>$}},
