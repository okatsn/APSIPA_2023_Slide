## Overview of soil water content (SWC) estimation {.scrollable}

### Importance of SWC estimation

- Enhance agricultural practices
- Water resource optimization
- Efficient urban green space management
- Flood risk assessment

### Conventional approaches

#### Direct measurement

- gravimetric method ^[@reynoldsGravimetricMethodSoil1970], the nuclear resonance method ^[@hendricksNuclearMagneticResonance1999,@Dawson2017BoreholeNM,@SHEN2019OptimizedInsideOutNMR]

<!-- which involves drying soil samples and measuring the weight loss -->
<!-- , which measures the interaction of water molecules with a magnetic field -->
#### Indirect measurements (Monitoring)

- resistivity methods ^[@Brunet2010MonitoringSW], tension methods ^[@bittelliMeasuringSoilWater2010,@shekharSoilMoistureProfile2017], dielectric methods ^[@Tokov2019MeasurementOV,@Sparks2022AReviewTDR,@Robinson2023AReviewTDR], and fiber optic sensing ^[@Cosenza2016IndirectDO,@aldabaMicrostructuredOpticalFiber2018,@sunDevelopmentApplicationFiberOptic2022]


## Machine learning in SWC measurement {.scrollable}

Due to economic and deployment reasons, in-situ SWC monitoring is generally spatially sparse.
Therefore, physically based numerical models and data-driven models are required on one hand to fill gaps in SWC measurement instrumentation.

### Role:

- forecasting
- interpolation


### PROs:

- Speed: fast in making a prediction
- Flexibility: require much less detailed and comprehensive hydraulic parameters

<!-- ML models can be trained on more diverse data sources without the need for explicit boundary conditions and initial conditions. -->

### CONs:

- Interpretability: lack physics-based and mechanistic understanding





## In this study

- We investigate the feasibility of using the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm in SWC estimation. 
- CART models are trained using **meteorological data**^[such as precipitation, air temperature and pressure] from a grassland terrain in northern Taiwan

### Why we choose CART

- In SWC estimation, the top-performing models are mostly 
  - Artificial Neural Network
  - CART-based models, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees
- Intrinsic ability of feature selection
- Provide inherent feature importance metrics such as impurity decrease

<!-- It is often chosen as the weak learner for ensemble learning, such as random forests, and gradient boosting machines, such as XGBoost \citep{ChenXGBoost2016}, which have dominated Kaggle competitions in recent years \citep{bentejacComparativeAnalysisGradient2021}. -->

<!-- CART is chosen for its simplicity, intrinsic feature selection ability, and extensibility to more sophisticated tree algorithms like RF and boosted trees. -->

# Research Methodology 

## 12-fold Time-Series Cross-validation (TSCV)


![](MissingData_TrainTestPartitions.png)


- training & testing dataset always contains consecutive data points
- testing fold always occurs after the training fold
- more representative of how the model will be used in realistic deployments


## Machine Learning Algorithm & Framework {.scrollable}

### Classification And Regression Tree (CART)

provided by [JuliaAI/DecisionTree.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAI/DecisionTree.jl).

Regression tree:

- is a supervised ML method capable for time-series forecasting; 
- is constructed by minimizing MSE^[mean squared error] by recursively creating binary branches; 

$$
    \min_{j, s}[\min_{c_L} \displaystyle\sum_{x_i \in R_L(j,s)}(y_i-c_L)^2 +
        \min_{c_R} \displaystyle\sum_{x_i \in R_R(j,s)}(y_i-c_R)^2 ]
$$

![](Fig_tree_visual_example.png){width=85%}


- is also a widely applied feature analysis/selection tool.


### Random Forest

Ensemble model of CART built with [MLJ](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/).

- 100 CART per model
- bagging ratio = 0.8


# Results & Discussion

## Effectiveness of Random Forest in SWC Estimation{.scrollable}

![](Fig_Timeseries_every_depth_TimeSeriesCV_with_P.png)

::: {layout-nrow="2"}
![](Fig_lossMAE_every_depthxfold_TimeSeriesCV.png)

- Model failed when transiting from dry to wet season (large MAE in $8_{th}$ fold for SWC of depths $\geq 70$ cm)
- Model failed to give predictions that are not in the training data (large MAE in $3_{th}$ fold for SWC of depths $> 10$ cm)
:::

::::

For the rest of models, MAE $\leq 4 \% (V/V)$ 

- Overestimating SWC by 4 % for SWC at 10 cm results in an 8 mm or around 7.2 tons of water deficit per 0.1 hectare farmland; 7.2 tons is 7.2 ‰ of water demand for rice per 0.1 hectare, while the water demands of soybeans and wheat are $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{1}{10}$ of that for rice, respectively.
- It indicates that **the continuous estimation error of more than 20 days may start to influence rice production**, which manifests the value of the estimated SWC information in this study.

## Underlying hydrodynamics revealed by CART {.scrollable}

### Importance of input features

Assessing responsiveness of SWC to precipitation using TDNI and TNNS

- *TDNI*: Total Decrease in Node Impurity
- *TNNS*: Total Number of Node Splits

> *AP & P parameters*: Accumulated Precipitation (10-minutes, 1-hr, 12-hr, 1-day, 2-day, 3-day)
>
> *NP parameters*: temperature, humidity, pressure, solar radiation, wind speed

<!-- 
![](ManyImportance_by_APP_NP.png)

Low TDNI of AP & P in dry season 

- In wet season, SWC of all depths response promptly to small rainfalls
- In dry season, SWC of deeper depths barely response to small rainfalls

High TNNS of NP for all seasons

- In wet season, NP parameters help in making finer predictions (near leaf)
- In dry season, NP parameters makes critical decisions in a tree (near root) -->

- fine grains in the topsoil ($\leq 10 cm$) ➡️ High water retention ability
- coarse grain in the middle layer ($30 - 70$ cm) ➡️ Preferential flow in the mid-layer






# Conclusion

## Brief summary {.scrollable}

- CART alone provides SWC predictions with acceptable error for some agricultural purposes.
- Random Forest provides comprehensive improvements comparing to CART.
- CART's intrinsic feature importance metrics can be used to assess the responsiveness of SWC to specific meteorological parameters.
- The results of feature importance analysis reflect the underground hydrodynamics and the seasonal variation of the evapotranspiration mechanism of the site.
